@Description: 
    the power operator is represented by two asterisks **. 
    It's used to raise a number to a specified power. 
    Here's how you can use the power operator.
"""

# Using the power operator
result = 2 ** 3  # 2 raised to the power of 3
print(result)    # Output: 8

# Power operator with float numbers
float_result = 3.5 ** 2
print(float_result)  # Output: 12.25

# Power operator with negative exponents
negative_exponent = 10 ** -2
print(negative_exponent)  # Output: 0.01

"""
The power operator allows you to perform exponentiation easily in Python. 
You can use it with both integer and floating-point numbers, as well as 
with negative exponents to calculate reciprocals.
